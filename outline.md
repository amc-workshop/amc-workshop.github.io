# Rough Workshop Outline

## Setting the stage (10 mins)

* Introduce Cassie and me and Position (1 min)
* Give an overview of what's going to happen (1 min)
* Access needs? Photo/video needs? etc needs? (1 min)
* Etherpad, hashtag, Twitter handles, etc (1 min)
* Check in with group -- very briefly (5 mins)
  * just want to get an idea of why people are attending
  * Who has used Github before? What about a git GUI? git command line too?
  *  Who here is a programmer or wants to learn to code?
  * Who here wants  to work on free or open source software? (whether in programming, design, testing, documentation, translation, whatever...)
  * (Thinking maybe if people are mostly wanting to learn git as part of learning to code or contribute to open source, we could lean just a little more on a conceptual understanding of how git works, to prepare for more advanced usage. If people are mostly just curious about what this git thing is and how they can use it, then that is just distracting.)
 
## What is git for? (10 mins)

* What is the problem that git solves?
    * How do you keep versions of your work?
    * How do you work on large projects with others?
  * How does git solve this problem?

## What is Github for? (5 mins)
  * the relationship between github and git?
  * find some analogy?

## A project for us to work on together - a website about how git works (10 mins)
  
* Share the website address (amc-workshop.github.io)
* Explain that it is Github and a static site generator and nothing to do with git
* Share the repo in the Etherpad and make sure everyone can find the github page.
* Show how the directory is structured
  * Compare to "My Documents" on Windows - files within folders within folders
* Quickly demonstrate forking the repo, editing a file, committing, creating a pull request, merging it -- and seeing the result on the github.io site
  * **OMG PRACTICE THIS**
  * would like it to be under 1 minute!!

## Creating a Github account then take break (5-10 mins)
  * Halfway point
  * Check in -- how does everyone feel about the pace? Too fast, too slow?

## Doing stuff on Github (35 mins)

* Issues and creating an issue (5 mins)
* Forking a repo and what is a fork? (9 mins)
* Editing a file on your fork and making a commit (9 mins)
* Making and merging pull requests (4 mins) -- just pushing the button, but also showing a more complicated example that results in a merge conflict and how that has to be resolved in the GUI

## Closing (10 mins)

* Using git as a programmer <- this is something we can talk about at length, so a good filler if for some reason we finish early!
* Where to go next, resources, GUIs, command line
* Keep using and contributing to the repo!
* Feedback!!
